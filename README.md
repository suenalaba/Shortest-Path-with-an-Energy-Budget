# Shortest path problem with constraint satisfaction

## Overview

We aim to find the shortest path of the NYC instance described in the 9th [DIMACS](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it//challenge9/download.shtml) implementation challenge. <br>
Task 1 finds the shortest distance with no constraint using A Star <br>
Task 2 finds the shortest distance with constraint using an uninformed search: UCS <br>
Task 3 finds the shortest distance with constraint using an informed search: A Star <br>

## Setting up

### Install dependencies

1. Ensure you have python3 OR python installed.
2. Run `python3 --version` and it should display the version if you have successfully installed.
3. Else run `python --version` and it should display the version if you have successfully installed.
4. If you do not have `python` or `python3` you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setup from ZIP File

1. Unzip the file, and change directory to the folder.
2. Depending on the above dependency described, run `python3 main.py` or `python main.py` and the program should run.
3. If there are any problems with the zip file you can download it from this [link](https://github.com/suenalaba/Shortest-Path-with-an-Energy-Budget)
   - click the green `code` button and select `Download zip`

### Setup from command line

1. Make sure you have git installed.
2. Change to your preferred directory and run
   `git clone https://github.com/suenalaba/Shortest-Path-with-an-Energy-Budget.git`
3. Change directory into the cloned folder
4. Run `python3 main.py` or `python main.py` and `Task 1 Results: ` should be printed.

### Generate output into txt

1. To transfer results into a .txt run `python3 main.py >> output.txt` or `python main.py >> output.txt`
